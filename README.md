# Women Safety Website


The Women Safety Website is a dedicated platform designed to enhance the safety and security of women in various environments, providing essential tools for real-time assistance and preventive measures. Developed during my internship, this project responds to the growing concerns about women's safety, leveraging web technology to offer a reliable and accessible solution for immediate help and community support.

Key features include:
- **Emergency Alert System**: An instant SOS alert system that allows users to send their real-time location to pre-selected contacts in case of an emergency, ensuring help is always just a tap away.
- **Real-Time Location Navigation**: Safe route navigation that takes into account well-lit streets, public spaces, transportation hubs, and nearby authorities, providing users with the safest path to their destination.
- **Safety Tips and Guidelines**: A comprehensive library of practical safety tips and guidelines that help users navigate a variety of situations, from traveling alone to dealing with harassment and emergencies.
- **Community Support and Resources**: A feature that connects users to local support groups, hotlines, and resources, creating a community of support and shared experiences to foster long-term safety and empowerment.

The project was developed with a user-centered design approach, prioritizing ease of use and accessibility for women of all ages and technical backgrounds. The interface is designed to be intuitive, ensuring users can quickly access vital features during critical moments. Built using HTML, JavaScript, CSS, ReactJs for the front end, and Node.js with MongoDB on the backend, this project provides a robust and secure platform to manage user data effectively. The Women Safety Website aims to be a one-stop resource, equipping women with tools and knowledge for greater personal security.
